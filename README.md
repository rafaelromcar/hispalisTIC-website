===================

Website of Hispalis-TIC

Requirements
Django version 1.4.5
SQLite3
Python 2.7.3

This repository will try to be my way of practicing with Django, Python and maybe with TDD. 
It's just an example of a simple website with a blog with categories, static pages and a file upload system.
In addition I will try to learn some of website desing with HTML5 and CSS3.
